## After training

We did some technical sparring sessions, 3x2' sparring against different opponents, followed by analysis, then repeat.

Results: class still relies on cuts as a solution to atajo/deviations, rendering them vulnerable to pressure and disarm ("hanging sword"). Too square positions (Rafa≈Ç), also lack of knowledge to exploit vulnerability against a hanging sword. Careless control of the distance leads to being hit.

Personal: usual mistake of fast cut without stepping, results in double or parried and hit. Also not much diagonal movement, mostly circular. Not much use for advancing against the body side. Got injured lightly on the right wrist - cut from Piotr.
