When I was starting in HEMA, back in Madrid, we were of course doing Verdadera Destreza. That was the system we were _told_ we were following for all weapons - rapier, longsword, sword and buckler. Granted, for longsword we incorporated some terms from Kunst des Fechtens, and for sword and buckler we were _supposedly_ doing something from I.33, but Destreza was the glue that tied them all. 

We were not even really much aware of the existence of other schools; we rarely travelled abroad, and not many practitioners from abroad came to our school. Some of us _migh_ have heard of authors such as Capoferro, Agrippa, Thibaut, Fabris, etc. but I suspect most people's knowledge of them came from __The Princess Bride__.

We didn't really know how these foreign fencers used to fence. We didn't even know how they even looked like. The only other _school_ we knew of, if only to dismiss it, was the Vulgar Destreza, or common fencing. Which we only used as a kind of negative example: "don't do that, that's vulgar" or "a vulgar fencer would do such and such". Nothing particularly detailed. In our accounts, vulgar fencers were basically a bunch of morons who didn't know how to fence.

I want to be perfectly clear here: very little of this is the responsibility of our Masters and Instructors, many of which, I'm pretty sure, had indeed taken the effort of learning at least a bit from those schools, and found them lacking. But we never had the chance of understanding _why_ did they. We never (or at least I can't recall any) had a comparative class, in which we were told what X author proposed, and why, and why from a Destreza point of view that was not good, or what needed to be adjusted, or whatever. Nothing. 

But we of course sort of inherited this dismissal of other schools. "Of course Italian fencing is crap! Of course it doesn't work! Of course a proper _diestro_ will always be able to defeat a crappy Italian fencer!". Reassurance that what one does is indeed the _best thing ever_ is as important in fencing as is anywhere else, I suppose. School loyalty and all that. 

The point I want to make here is a caveat for instructors: __you__ might take the bother to read all those sources, and find out what doesn't work in them, but you need to bring that knowledge to your students. If you just share your dismissal for those schools without explaining the why, you'll just train a bunch of people to be arrogant around other practitioners. I know I was one - probably I still am.
