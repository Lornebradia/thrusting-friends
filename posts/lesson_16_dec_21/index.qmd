## After training

Did a little bit of sparring, introduced the idea of technical, tournament and duel sparring. More examples will be needed. 

Observations on personal sparring: need to train very basic stuff at full speed such as: 
atajos, full speed sparring. 

Response to reverse, especially when opponent pushes down (needs more movement of the body to reach an appropriate medio for the thrust under arm or for the half reverse cut)

Maintaining the defensive plane under pressure, especially on the sword side but also in the profile. In general, working more specific things that happen at full speed.
